# [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays)

<p>Given two sorted arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> of size <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> respectively, return <strong>the median</strong> of the two sorted arrays.</p>

<p>The overall run time complexity should be <code>O(log (m+n))</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2.00000
<strong>Explanation:</strong> merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2.50000
<strong>Explanation:</strong> merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>nums1.length == m</code></li>
	<li><code>nums2.length == n</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= m &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m + n &lt;= 2000</code></li>
	<li><code>-10<sup>6</sup> &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>
</ul>

This solution solves the **"Median of Two Sorted Arrays"** problem in **logarithmic time** using **binary search**, and your confusion lies in:

```js
let k = Math.ceil((m + n) / 2);
let nums2Mid = k - nums1Mid;
```

Letâ€™s first understand the **goal**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ Goal: Find the Median of Two Sorted Arrays

* When the combined length `(m + n)` is **odd**, the **median** is the `k`-th smallest number.
* When `(m + n)` is **even**, the **median** is the **average** of the `k`-th and `(k+1)`-th smallest numbers.

In both cases, the **median lies around the middle**, so this solution tries to **find the k-th smallest element** in the merged array, without actually merging them.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why `let k = Math.ceil((m + n) / 2);`

We are performing binary search to find the correct partition between `nums1` and `nums2` such that:

* The **left half** contains `k` elements.
* The **right half** contains the rest.

We want to divide the combined arrays into **two halves**, such that:

* All elements on the **left** are less than or equal to all elements on the **right**.
* The **left half has k elements**.

So `k = Math.ceil((m + n) / 2)` is the **target number of elements** on the left side.

> Even if the total length is even, we use `ceil()` because later we handle the even case by taking average of middle two numbers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why `let nums2Mid = k - nums1Mid;`

We are **binary searching** in `nums1` to find the correct number of elements to take from it (`nums1Mid`), so that the total left side (nums1 + nums2) has exactly `k` elements.

Hence:

```js
nums2Mid = k - nums1Mid;
```

This ensures that the total number of elements taken from `nums1` and `nums2` for the **left half** is exactly `k`.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Summary

* `k = Math.ceil((m + n) / 2)` â†’ number of elements we want on the **left side** of the combined arrays.
* `nums1Mid = guess of how many elements to take from nums1`.
* `nums2Mid = k - nums1Mid` â†’ the rest comes from nums2.

This setup lets the algorithm **partition both arrays correctly** and find the median in `O(log(min(m, n)))` time.

Let me know if you'd like a **step-by-step example** to see how this works in practice.
