Great question! Let's break down:

```js
if (num < 0) {
  num += 2 ** 32; // Same as (1 << 32) + num in Go
}
```

### ðŸ§  What this does

When `num` is **negative**, we **manually convert it to its 32-bit unsigned representation**.

JavaScript uses **floating point numbers**, and doesnâ€™t distinguish between signed/unsigned integers directly. So to mimic how negative integers are stored in memory (two's complement), we do:

```
num + 2^32
```

This is how negative numbers are represented in memory in most programming languages (like Go or C) using **twoâ€™s complement** format.

---

### âœ… Example: `num = -1`

In Go:

```go
(1 << 32) + (-1) = 4294967295
```

In JS:

```js
-1 + 2 ** 32 = 4294967295
```

Which is:

```txt
0xffffffff  // hexadecimal representation
```

So `-1` becomes `0xffffffff` â†’ `"ffffffff"` in hex.

---

### âœ… Why we do this

Hex output expects an **unsigned 32-bit number**, even for negative input. This shift:

```js
num += 2 ** 32;
```

is a **trick to reinterpret a negative number as its 32-bit unsigned equivalent** so that the hex conversion behaves the same as Go or C.

---

Let me know if you'd like a version using bitwise operations instead (`>>> 0` is another trick to do this in JavaScript).
