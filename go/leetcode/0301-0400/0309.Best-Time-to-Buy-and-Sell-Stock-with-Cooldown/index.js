// state should be understood as the consequence of our previous actions, and what action we can do at current state.
//stateA:
// [Consequence] State not immediate after selling; Doesn't have any stock;
// [Action can take] Buy a new stock / Continue to take a rest

// stateB:
// [Consequence] State with stock in hand;
// [Action can take] Sell a stock / Continue to take a rest

// stateC:
// [Consequence] State immediate after selling; Doesn't have any stock (since just sell one to enter this state)
// [Action can take] Enters next state by taking a rest (since stateC is only for state immediate after selling, we cannot stay here.)
